# NCSU-Research
This repository contains the various research project materials I created in the Applied Cognitive Psychology and NeuroComputational Ethics Research Labs at NCSU. The projects explore the promising potential of virtual reality technologies to enhance the resolution of cognitive science experimentation. In addition to advancing theoretical insights, this work has practical applications, such as assisting engineers in designing autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior informed by human intuitions and bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world problem-solving.

## 2021 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Submission - Beat the Bots
The HFES was my first conference presentation during my tenure in the Applied Cognitive Psychology Lab. I presented a virtual poster on the Beat the Bots study, which investigated the impact of placebo manipulation on performance in the online game League of Legends. This research explored whether expectancy effects influenced cognitive and motor task performance within a dynamic, real-time strategy game environment. While yielding null results, the study highlighted the potential of video games as experimental platforms due to their capacity for high-resolution data collection and ecological validity. This project led to my first publication.

Additionally, I contributed to a complementary literature review examining the distinction between the concepts of presence and immersion in virtual reality, culminating in my second publication. Both works underscore the viability of using virtual task environments to investigate psychological phenomena and behavioral processes.

## 2022 International Neuroethics Society Submission - Conceptual engineering study of moral judgment using virtual reality
This submission marked my first conference presentation as a member of the NeuroComputational Ethics Research Group at NCSU. The project explored how virtual reality (VR) can be used to increase the ecological validity of moral psychology experiments while addressing ethical challenges in autonomous vehicle (AV) decision-making. By operationalizing the Agent-Deed-Consequence (ADC) model of moral judgment into visually rich, language-independent virtual traffic scenarios, this study provided a novel framework for cross-cultural investigations into human moral intuitions.

The study involved designing VR-based moral vignettes that avoided the limitations of textual formats, such as linguistic and cultural biases, enabling realistic and immersive experimentation. Key findings highlighted the potential for VR simulations to refine AV ethical goal functions by leveraging cross-cultural data on moral judgments. This work underlines the critical role of methodological innovation in addressing the ethical complexities of emerging technologies.

## 2023 South/North Carolina Philosophical Society Submission - Moving Away from The Trolley Problem: A paradigm shift in ethics of autonomous vehicles
This NCPS presentation builds on the foundation laid by my earlier INS submission, emphasizing the methodological shortcomings of using sacrificial dilemmas, such as the Trolley Problem, in autonomous vehicle (AV) ethics research. The presentation critiques the Moral Machine Experiment (MME) for its reliance on binary high-stakes scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of moral decision-making and lack external validity.

To address these issues, I proposed a paradigm shift in experimental design by employing the Agent-Deed-Consequence (ADC) model of moral judgment and virtual reality (VR) technologies. The ADC model integrates virtue ethics, deontology, and utilitarianism, allowing for a nuanced exploration of moral evaluations in traffic scenarios. By using VR to simulate realistic, low- to medium-stakes dilemmas, this approach enhances experimental, mundane, and psychological realism while maintaining the scalability required for large-scale data collection.

This work represents an effort to move beyond abstract philosophical exercises and offer practical, empirically grounded insights that can inform the development of ethically acting AVs. It highlights the importance of designing trust-enhancing Ethics Settings (ESs) by aligning AV behavior with human moral intuitions.

## 2023 International Neuroethics Society Submission - The Role of Virtual Task Environments in Probing Human Cognition: Opportunities and Obstacles
This submission to the INS highlights the growing adoption of Virtual Task Environments (VTEs) for cognitive science and neuroethics research, focusing on their potential to add ecological validity to human cognition studies. It explores how VTEs enable the collection of complex, interactive behavioral data while ensuring physical safety, such as capturing both state variables like reaction time and geometric decision patterns. The submission also discusses limitations like resource constraints, participant responses to stressful stimuli, and the complexity of analyzing unique decision paths.

While I did not attend this conference, this abstract serves as a precursor to Ludus Moralis, emphasizing VTEs as transformative tools for interdisciplinary research into human decision-making, moral reasoning, and the design of artificial moral agents.

## 2024 North/South Carolina Philosophical Society Submission - Ludus Moralis
This folder contains my final conference submission, "Ludus Moralis," which explores the need for innovative task stimuli in moral psychology research. The paper advocates for gamified virtual task environments as a solution to persistent challenges in the field, such as low ecological validity and the over-reliance of researchers on abstract moral dilemmas like the trolley problem. By incorporating real-time, interactive decision-making scenarios into experiments, this approach aims to enhance realism, engagement, and the practical relevance of findings. The methodology also proposes using geometric data analysis of participantsâ€™ in-game behaviors, linking moral decisions to measurable patterns over time. This submission represents the culmination of my efforts to merge philosophical inquiry with technological innovation.
