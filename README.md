# NCSU-Research
This repo contains the various research project materials I created in the Applied Cognitive Psychology and NeuroComputational Ethics Research labs at NCSU. It showcases the promising nature of virtual reality technologies for increasing the resolution of cognitive science experimentation.

## 2021 Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Submission - Beat the Bots
The HFES was my first conference and the only conference I submitted to during my time in the Applied Cognitive Psychology lab. I presented the Beat the Bots idea via a virtual poster, which addresses the question "Video games as psychological research tools. A helpful addition or an unnecessary layer?" by outlining the remote experiment I performed on League of Legends player. This work resulted in my first publication and done in conjunction with a literature review that led to my second publication. Both URLs are provided below.

## 2022 International Neuroethics Society Submission - Conceptual engineering study of moral judgment using virtual reality
This submission to the INS was my first conference admittance during my time in the NeuroComputational Ethics Research Group. It is my first attempt at stressing the importance of increasing the ecological validity of moral psychology experimentation using virtual environments in the face of pressing ethical issues in AI. In short, it suggests using ADC model operationalized virtual vignettes to examine cross-cultural human judgments regarding mundane moral traffic dilemmas to inform the ethical settings of autonomous vehilces.

## 2023 North/South Carolina Philosophical Society Submission - Moving Away from The Trolley Problem: A paradigm shift in ethics of autonomous vehicles
This NCPS follows the same trend, as the earlier INS submission, but expands on why the current experimental practices were following short of being practically informative and

## 2024 North/South Carolina Philosophical Society Submission - Ludus Moralis
This folder contains my final conference submission, which specifically explores the need for better task stimuli in moral psychology research and presents video games as a solution to some of the experimental issues of the field.
